# Race description
The Sakkra are a race of reptiles with impressive regenerative capabilities.   As a result, their population grows at twice the normal rate.  They are  subterranean, living both under and above the surface of a planet, increasing  the maximum population a planet can support by twice the planet's size. The Sakkra  are very good at agriculture giving them a bonus of +1 food per farmer, but somewhat  inept at spying with a -10 to all spying activities. The Sakkra come from a  large home world and have a feudal form of government.
