# Race description
The Alkari are an avian race which have descended from great flying reptiles.  Alkari pilots are reared from a young age on the dynamics of 3-dimensional motion.  As a result the  Alkari boast superior pilots, gaining a +50 defensive bonus in space combat. Furthermore,  the Alkari homeworld was once colonized by the Orions, and still possesses ancient artifacts. The Alkari have a dictatorial government.
