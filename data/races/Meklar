# Race description
The Meklars are a cybernetic race that have become extremely dependent on their  cybernetic exoskeletons, to the point that their bodies have atrophied to small fragile  frames.  Unlike other races, Meklars consume 1/2 production and 1/2 food each, rounded  up. Their cybernetic interfaces allow them to completely repair their ships  after combat. In addition 10% of their ship's structure and 5% of their ship's internal  systems are repaired each round of combat. Meklar factory workers produce +2 production each. Meklars have a dictatorial form of government.
