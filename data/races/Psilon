# Race description
The Psilons are a delicate race of brilliant researchers from a Low-G home world. Each Psilon scientist produces 2 more research than the galactic norm. In  addition, the Psilons are very creative, and they never ignore a potential  avenue of research. Thus, all technologies are available to their scientists. Their large home world doesn't hurt either. They are ruled by a Dictatorship.
