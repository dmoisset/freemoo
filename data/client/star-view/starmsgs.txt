Black holes are ancient stars that have collapsed into a minor fraction of  their original size. So powerful are the effects of a black hole, that no  ship may pass within two parsecs.
The blue-white stars are the hottest of all the stars, emitting extreme amounts of solar radiation. The blue-white star is likely to have planets that will be mineral rich, but totally unsuitable for supporting life.
White stars have a fair chance of having planets. If present, these planets  will be high in mineral resources, but can barely support life.
Yellow stars are the same spectral class as our sun. The yellow star will quite frequently have planets with moderate mineral resources and a good  environment for supporting life.
Orange stars will frequently have planets with the best chance of being habitable, but tend to be poor in mineral resources.
Red stars are the dimmest, coolest stars. The have a poor chance of having planets. If planets do exist, they will have minimal environments and extremely poor mineral resources.
Brown stars are really cool! They're so cool that astronomers throughout the galaxy have been unable to put their majestic beauty into words. Perhaps after another millenium of study, our vocabulary will have been increased  sufficiently to describe these bundles of joy!
