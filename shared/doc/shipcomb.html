<A NAME=warships><H2>1.1 WarShips</H2><BR>
     The term "WarShip" refers to any armed, non-support military
vessel used for exploration, expansion(conquest), and defense. 
Although interstellar empires often have gigantic fleets of
support vessels -- trade ships, freighters, transports,
communications probes, etc. -- it is often an empire's warfleet
that draws it the most attention, and respect.  And it is the
warships that do the fighting in the cold depths of space. 
Naturally, it is these battles that roleplayers are most
concerned with.<BR>
     The nuts and bolts of ship combat will be covered in the
next section.  First, a prospective warrior must understand how a
warship is put together and the statistics that describe it's
structure.<P>

<A NAME=intstru><H2>1.2 Internal Structure:  The Guts of a WarShip</H2><BR>
     A warship's "internal structure" is analogous to a
biological creature's skeleton (assuming we're talking about
endoskeletal creatures -- that is, creatures with internal
skeletons).  The internal structure is the framework that holds
the ship's vital systems, and supports it against the forces
exerted by rapid acceleration and complex manuvers.
     There are five "size classes" of ship.  The larger the ship,
the more internal structure required to support it and its vital
systems.  This also means larger ships can take more punishment
from weapons before the internal framework is damaged to the
point that the natural torques and accelerations of combat
manuvers collapse the internal structure and rip the ship apart.
     This damage that a ship can take before breaking up is
referred to as structural integrety (abbreviated SI for short). 
When a ship takes damage from a weapon strike, a certain number
of points are subtracted from the ship's SI.  When SI is reduced
to 0 or less, the ship's structure has been damaged beyond its
ability to withstand the stresses of spaceflight.  At this point
nothing can save the ship -- even if the ship wasn't executing
some sort of combat manuver the torques and accelerations placed
on the ship by the weapons hit are too much for the weakened
frame, which is quickly torn apart.  In short, when a ship loses
all of its SI, it breaks apart and is destroyed.<P>

<A NAME=spacecrit><H2>1.3 Space and Critical Slots</H2><BR>
     The internal structure of a warship only allows so many
weapons and systems to be installed before there is no more room. 
There are two quantities that are used to keep track of what has
been placed on board a craft, and how much room is left for more: 
space and critical slots.<BR>
     Space simply refers to the absolute amount of hull space
available inside the ship for weapons and systems.  Each weapon
or system installed (obviously) requires a certain amount of
space.  This required space is subtraced from a ship's available
space if the system is installed; when there is no more space
left on the ship, nothing more can be installed.  Of course if
there is space left in the hull, but not enough for a prospective
new system, that system cannot be installed.<BR>
     Critical slots are similar to space;  they are filled up as
more systems are crammed into the hull.  However, critical slots
designate were on a ship a system has been placed.  All ships
have four facings:  forward, rear, left, and right.  When a ship
is first designed, its total number of critical slots are
distributed among these four facings.  Systems placed in a
critical slot in a certain facing are considered to be located in
that facing.  For example, a fusion beam placed in a forward
critical slot is assumed to be on the forward side of the ship
pointing into the (you guessed it) forward firing arc.  Obviously
the critical slots for the engine are predominantly in the rear
of the ship.  So, what are critical slots really used for?  First
of all, a weapon's location on a ship determines which firing arc
it can target opponents in.  Second, any internal damage done to
a ship has a chance of damaging or destroying an internal system
(the battle computer, the shield generator, the engine, a special
system, or a weapon).  Shots that come from the forward direction
are most likely to damage systems in the forward part of the ship
-- so any critical hits (damage to internal systems) are most
likely to be to the systems in the forward part of the ship,
which are represented by the forward critical slots.<BR>
     There are a three rules regarding the distribution of
critical slots on a ship.  First, each facing must have at least
one critical slot.  Second, no facing can have more than 50% of a
ship's total critical slots.  Third, the left and right sides
must have the same number of critical slots (to properly balance
the ship).  Other than this, the ship designer is free to assign
a ship's critical slots as he or she sees fit.
     The number of criticals a device requires depends on the
space it requires:<P>  

<B>(number of criticals) = (space)/10</B><P>  

This
value is rounded to the nearest whole number with only two
exceptions.  First, any special devices that each take up 5 or
less space can share a critical slot with each other.  Up to 14
space worth of specials can be assigned in this way.  Second,
like weapons may be assigned to critical slots as weapon pods. 
Up to 14 space worth of the weapon can be assigned in this manner
to each critical slot.  All weapons assigned to the same slot
must be identical, and are controlled as a group:  one roll is
made when they are fired.  The weapons either all hit the target
or none of them hit the target!<BR>
     Finally, in addition to the listed number of "free" critical
slots (see Table 4-2), all ships have some engine criticals that
represent the engine core.  Half of the engine criticals must be
located in the rear of the ship.  The remaining slots can be
placed in the rear, or distributed evenly on each side.  In
addition to the engine criticals, a ship using a battle computer
has one additional critical slot devoted to it.  This slot can be
placed wherever the designer wishes.<P>

<A NAME=armor><H2>1.4 Armor</H2><BR>
     All warships have armor:  a thin layer of ultra-tough alloy
that protects the ship's internal structure and systems (and
crew) from high and low energy radiation (from stellar sources
and also cosmic rays), micrometeoroids, and, of course, the
weapons of other warships.  The principle behind armor is simple: 
devise a substance that is thin, relatively lightweight, and
promotes dissipation of kinetic energy and heat across its
surface rather than through its surface and into the ship's
internal support.  In other words, a weapon strike on a ship's
armor tends to blast off a section of the armor, rather than
lance through layers of internal structure.<BR>
     All ships have a certain base amount of armor.  These armor
points are distributed across a ship's four facings as the
designer sees fit, with only three restrictions.  First, every
side must be given at least 10% of the total armor.  Second, no
side can have more than 50% of the total armor.  Finally, the
left and right sides of the ship must have equal amounts of
armor.<BR>
     Armor works much like SI.  A weapon hit on a certain facing
of a ship reduces that ship's armor points by a certain amount. 
Once the armor on that facing has been depleted (no more armor
points left), any further strikes on that facing damage the
ship's internal structure (SI) instead.<BR>
     More advanced materials than the standard titanium can be
used for armor, of course.  These give a ship bonus armor points
above its base number of armor points.  This bonus is expressed
as a percentage of the base.  For example, Zortrium gives a bonus
of +300%, so if a small ship has a base of 16 armor points,
Zortium gives it 48 more armor points, for a total of 64!<BR>
     Furthermore, since the materials used in armor are often
used to strengthen and reinforce a ship's internal framework,
advanced materials technology also adds bonus SI points using the
same formula as the addition of bonus armor points.  So, going
back to the above example, a small ship has 8 SI.  Zortium armor
would give it 24 more, for a total of 36 SI.

<A NAME=shields><H2>1.5 Shields:  The First Line of Defense</H2>
     Deflector shields are powerful electromagnetic/gravitic
energy fields that surround warships.  Deflector shields function
by taking the natural electrical charge inherant to all matter
and, through rapid modulation, dispersing this electric charge
over the local area of the "shield matrix" (the lines of force
that describe the region of space where the shield exists).  This
causes beam weapons (even lasers, due to their electromagnetic
nature) to lose coherance (and, thus, force) and "heavy matter"
weapons (mass drivers and missiles) to be "deflected" violently
away from the ship.  In the case of missiles, this violent
deflection often detonates the warheads; the force of the
explosion is itself deflected away from the ship.<BR>
     What makes a shield so effective is its localization:  the
region of projected electromagnetic force is so thin and dense
that the acceleration it provides to objects trying to penetrate
it is very extreme.  To a certain extent, a shield can absorb
force (i.e. damage) without any loss of this vital localization. 
This damage absorbed is rated as the shield's class.  Excess
damage is also deflected -- a shield lets nothing get through
until its localization is too weak to effectively deflect
anything -- but the excess kinetic energy forces the field to
become less localized.  Any deflector shield can only be
"thinned" out to a certain critical level before the force
absorption effect is too small to be of any use.  Until then,
however, the shield functions normally.  Obviously, the amount of
damage the shield can absorb outright is directly related to the
amount of excess damage it can soak up before its localization
smears out past the critical point -- the higher the shield's
class the more excess damage it can absorb before the shield
fails.<BR>
     Larger, more powerful shield generators can produce denser
fields, but not thicker fields.  So while the amount of damage
absorbed outright doesn't change, the shield can retain its
effectiveness after being "spread out" more.  In other words, the
larger shield generators on larger ships can absorb more excess
damage before failing.<BR>
     Like armor, shields have four facings (frontal, rear, left,
and right), each of which can absorb the given amount of damage
before failing.

*This is the amount of space the shield generators take up on the
ship.  The number of criticals required is equal to the amount of
space/10 rounded normally, to a minimum of 1 space.  Shields,
like other systems can be miniturized with advances in
technology.     
<P>
**This is for each of the four shield facings (see above).
<P>
     So for example, a medium ship with Class III shields is
struck from point-blank range by two phasor blasts (20 damage
each).  Three points of damage are totally blocked from each
blast.  Of the remaining 34 points of damage, 30 are absorbed by
the relevant facing of the shield before it collapses.  The
remaining 4 points are done to the armor on that facing.
<P>
<A NAME=engines><H2>1.6 WarShip Engines</H2><BR>
     Hyperspace is the only known alternate universe that exists
adjacent to every point in our universe.  Although distances in
hyperspace are identical to distances in our universe, certain
aspects of this "alternate reality" make it prime for travel
between the stars.  Specifically, the speed of electromagnetic
radiation in hyperspace is higher in hyperspace by orders of
magnitude, and the effects of inertia are greatly reduced.  The
net result:  even with a simple chemical rocket engine, a ship in
hyperspace can reach an appreciable fraction of the speed of
light in our universe.  So more advanced engines, like the
nuclear drive, or fusion engines, allow very efficient super-
luminal speeds.  Since all points in these universes coincide,
this allows relatively short travel times between stars using
rather conventional engines.  It also means that, with the
exception of a warp drive to push the ship into and out of
hyperspace, a ship doesn't need a separate drive for travel in
hyperspace and our universe.<BR>
     A ship's engine, in game terms, really refers to the actual
drive mechanism responsible for physically moving the ship (as
opposed to the warp core responsible for pushing it into and out
of hyperspace).  The engines determine both a ship's FTL speed
(for travel between stars) and its combat speed (for movement in
combat).  FTL speed is measured in parsecs/month.  Combat speed
is measured in movement points (MP).  One MP will move a ship
forward one hex on the combat map; Four MP will change its facing
by one hexside.<BR>
     Table 4-6 lists the base MP for a ship according to size
class (larger ships are slower) and engine type (more advanced
engines are faster).  However the base MP can be increased by up
to 10 if not all of the space on board the ship is used.  In
order to determine a ship's actual MP, divide remaining space by
total space and multiply by 10 (you may need a calculator for
this...).  Round the result to the nearest whole number, and add
it to the base MP.  The result is the actual MP.  For example, a
small ship with a fusion drive has a base MP of 12.  Pretend that
the ship has 10 space used, which means it has 15 space free:   
15 ö 25 = 0.6   10 = +6 MP.  So the ship has an actual MP of 18.

<A NAME=computer><H2>1.7 The Battle Computer:  The Eyes of Your Beam Weapons</H2>
     A ship's battle computer is a logistical system tied into
all of the ship's major weapons systems.  The battle computer
attempts to lock a beam weapon on an enemy target, calculate the
proper lead based on its analysis of the target's movements, and
fire the weapon in the direction that will allow it to strike the
target.<BR>
     In game terms, a battle computer adds a bonus to the chance
that a beam weapon will strike its target.

<A NAME=devices><H2>1.8 Beam Weapons and Special Devices:  The Good Stuff</H2><BR>
     With the details of the ship's basic construction and
systems dealt with, the final topic in ship construction is all
the goodies that can be added to a warship.<BR>
     These "goodies" come in two major categories:  weapons and
special systems:<BR>
     Weapons are devices designed to damage or destroy enemy
targets:  space stations, ground instillations, innocent
populations, and, of course, enemy warships.  Weapons come in a
variety of sizes and types, each with a different set of
capabilites.<BR>
     Beam weapons are, as the name implies, beams of subatomic
particles or coherant electromagnetic radiation that damage
targets by superheating or vaporizing their constituent
materials.  Because beam weapons lose coherance with distance
travelled, the damage they do is lessened as the range to the
target becomes more remote.<BR>
     Ballistic weapons behave much like beam weapons, but involve
launching heavy pieces of matter at the target.  They do damage
through the sheer power of their kinetic energy -- they violently
tear through the target.  Ballistics do not lose coherance in the
sense that beam weapons do:  although the spread of the ordinance
may increase very slightly with distance, each slug still has
just as much kinetic energy as when it left the gunnel. 
Therefore, the damage done by ballistic weapons is not reduced
with distance.  However, ballistic weapons do require ammo --
which takes up extra space.<BR>
     Missiles are guided, warhead-toting drones that deliver
explosive ordinance to their targets.  Thanks to their in-flight
guidance systems, missiles always hit their target.  This, of
course, assumes that they are not destroyed by weapons fire or
led astray by enemy electronic countermeasures.  Oh.  Although
missiles have unlimited range and accuracy, they only have finite
ammo supplies.<BR>
     Torpedoes are "energy projectiles" -- globs of very
energetic, unstable matter (or photons) in a magnetic confinement
field.  Upon striking the target, the confinement field ruptures. 
The resulting detonation damages the target.  Like missiles
torpedoes always hit unless they are led astray by electronic
countermeasure systems.  Luckily, torpedoes cannot be shot down. 
Sadly, they can only be fired every other turn.<BR>
     Fighters are small, manned spacecraft typically armed with
beam weapons or bombs.  Fighters seek out enemy targets, fire at
them from point blank range until running low on fuel, and then
return to their mothership for refuel and reload.<BR>
     Bombs are very high-yield explosive devices that can be
dropped on enemy ground targets.<BR>
     Special Devices are systems that somehow improve a ships
performance, often in combat.  They are too varied to go into in
any detail here, however.
<P>

<H1><CENTER>Chapter II - Combat</CENTER></H1>

<A NAME=ship2ship><H2>2.1 Ship-to-Ship Combat</H2><BR>
     When two hostile forces meet in space, the battle is played
out on a hex grid (two standard BattleTech mats lined up end to
end is a good playing field).  Ships, missiles, torpedoes, and
fighters are represented by tokens on the map (BattleSpace tokens
will work just fine for this purpose, or you can make your own). 
Although alternate set ups are possible, typically each side sets
up along a row on hexes on each side of the map.<BR>
     If the battle is taking place near a planet, the planet must
also be present on the map (usually on the defender's side, near
the center of the width of his/her side of the map).  The planet
hexes cannot be moved into, although they can be passed over. 
The size of the planet on the map is determined by its size in
the game (big shock!).  Small and Tiny worlds take up only 1 hex. 
A Normal sized or Large world have a 2 hex radius (1 central hex,
and all the adjacent hexes).  Likewise, a Huge world has a 3 hex
radius.  It is often only necessary to mark the world's central
hex on the map with a token of some sort; any other hexes
occupied by the planet are then easily inferred from the planet's
size.<BR>
     The first step in a hostile engagement is to determine
initiative.  This is done individually for each ship using the
following formula:<P>

<B>(Ship Beam Offense / 10) + Maximum MP</B>
<P>
     The result (rounded normally) is the ship's current
initiative value.  The ship with the highest value goes first,
followed by the ship with the next highest value, etc.  Two ships
with identical values move and attack simultaneously.<BR>
     Each ship, unless immobilized and disabled, gets a turn. 
During a ship's turn it can fire its weapons, use its special
devices, and move as far as its MP will allow.  Any weapons not
fired can be saved for later in the combat round, but once a
player states that a ship's turn is over, it cannot move again
that round.<P>

<A NAME=movement><H2>2.2 Movement</H2>
     Movement is simple.  A ship may only move in the direction
it is facing.  Each chance in facing or move forward costs the
ship a certain number of MP to execute.  The exact cost is given
in the table below:<P>

<P>
<A NAME=arcs><H2>2.3 Firing Arcs</H2><BR>
     Before a ship can fire its beam or ballistic weapons, it
must first determine which targets are in which weapon's firing
arcs.  If a target is out of a particular weapon's firing arc,
that weapon cannot fire at that target.<BR>
     All weapons mounted on the front of the ship (their
criticals are in the front) fire into the front firing arc.  The
line of hexes extending out from the hex faces immediatly left
and right of the ship's facing mark the boundaries of this firing
arc.<BR>
     Left mounted weapons can fire into the left firing arc.  The
line of hexes extending from the hexface to the left of the rear
hexface (the hex face opposite the facing) and the line of hexes
extending from the facing hexface mark the boundaries of the left
firing arc.<BR>
     Right mounted weapons can fire into the right firing arc. 
The line of hexes extending from the hexface to the right of the
rear hexface and the line of hexes extending from the facing
hexface mark the boundaries of the right firing arc.
     The rear mounted weapons fire into the (surprise!) rear
firing arc.  The line of hexes extending from the hexfaces to the
left and right of the rear hexface are the boundaries of the rear
firing arc.<BR>
     Missiles, torpedoes, fighters, and bombs do not have or use
firing arcs.  When missiles, torpedoes, and fighters are
launched, they launch into the hex in the direction of their
target.  Bombs require the ship to be adjacent to the planet
hexes (i.e. bombs have a range of 1).<BR>
     Also, a target in the same hex as the attacker in considered
to be in all of the attacker's firing arcs.
<P>
<A NAME=firing><H2>2.4 Firing Beam and Ballistic Weapons</H2>
     Both beam and ballistic weapons become less accurate as the
target gets further away.  Specifically, there is a penalty to
the chance to hit based on the range (in hexes) to the target.

<P>
     For a beam or a ballistic weapon, the chance to hit is
determined in the following way:
<P>
<B>(Beam Offense + Penalty + 10) - Target Beam Defense = Hit %</B>
<P>
     The attacker rolls a d100, and adds the result to the Hit %
number.  If the result is higher than zero, the attack hits.<BR>
     For example, an attacker with a positronic computer (+75%
beam offense) fires at a small target at a range of 15 hexes   
(-40% penalty).  The target has a beam defense of +90.  With this
information, Hit % = (75 - 40 + 10) - 90 = -45.  Therefore, the
attacker must roll higher than 45 on d100 to hit.
<P>
     In addition, beam weapons lose coherance with range.  This
causes the beam to do less than its given damage, as per the
following table:
<P>

<P>
     So, if in the above example, the weapon had been a standard
neutron beam (damage 12), the damage loss would have been -40%,
or -4.8 damage.  So the weapon would have done 12 - 5 = 7 points
of damage.  If the weapon was a heavy neutron beam (damage 18),
the damage loss would have been -20%, or -3.6 damage.  The weapon
would have done 18 - 4 = 14 damage.          
<P>
<A NAME=fmiss><H2>2.5 Firing Missiles and Torpedoes</H2>
     A missile or torpedoes is initially launched into the
hexface in the direction of its target.  All missiles and
torpedoes automatically get initiative at the beginning of the
next combat round.<BR>
     A missile has a movement rate of 12 spaces, +2 spaces for
every drive type researched beyond Nuclear.  A torpedo has a
movement rate of 24.<BR>
     When the missile or torpedo reaches the hex its target is
in, the attacker calculates the chance to hit.  Before the roll
is made, however, the defender may fire any point defense weapons
he or she has available at the missiles (range 0).  A missile's
defense rating is 40 + (5 per movement rate).  So, for example, a
missile using a Fusion Drive (Movement rate of 14 spaces) would
have a defense rating of 40 + 70 = +110.  The amount of damage a
missile can take without being destroyed depends on the type of
missile, and is given in the tables at the end of the combat
section.  Torpedoes can be jammed, but they cannot be shot down. 
The chance of a missile or torpedo hitting its target is given by
the following formula:<P>

<B>     100% + Scanner Bonus - Enemy Jammer = % Chance to Hit</B><P>

     The attacker rolls d100.  If the result is equal to or below
the % Chance to Hit, the missile or torpedo strikes the target
and does damage.<BR>
     The Scanner Bonus depends on the race's best available
scanner:

<P>
     Unless otherwise noted, missiles and torpedoes do not suffer
a penalty to damage with range.
<P>
<A NAME=fighters><H2>2.6 Fighters</H2>
     When launched at a target, each fighter squadron (4
fighters) enters the hexface in the direction to the target. 
Like missiles and torps, fighters always get initiative at the
beginning of the next combat turn.  A fighter's movement rate
depends on the type of fighter, but the squadrons will always
take the fastest, most direct route to the target.<BR>
     Upon arriving in the target's hex, as with missiles, the
defender may fire his or her point defense weapons at the
fighters.  The range is 0, and a fighter's defense rating is
calculated in the same way as a missile's.  A fighter has a base
defense rating of 40.<BR>
     Once any point defense is taken care of, each fighter
squadron fires at the target.  Interceptors carry the best point
defense weapon available.  Bombers carry the best bomb available. 
Heavy fighters carry two of the best point defense beams and two
of the best bombs.  While bombs automatically hit the target, a
squadron makes a single roll to see if all of its beams hit or
miss.  The chance of a beam weapon hitting is given by the
following formula:<P>

     <B>(Beam Offense + 45) - Target Beam Defense = % Hit</B>
<P>
     The attack itself is rolled once for each squad, and success
is determined in the same manner as for regular beam weapons.  If
the squad's attack hits, all of the beam weapons on the fighters
in the squad hit.  Attacks are always against the ship's weakest
shield facing.  If all of the ship's facings have the same shield
strength, the attacker chooses which facing the fighters attack.<BR>
     For example, a group of 12 interceptors (3 squads) with
Optronic computers (+50% Beam Offense) and point defense fusion
beams (3 damage) target an enemy cruiser with Class I Shields. 
The target's Beam Defense is 70.  50 + 45 - 70 = +25, so the hit
is automatic.  The damage done is thus (3 - 1) * 4 = 8.  Since
all the shield facings are at full, the attacker chooses to
target the rear shield facing.  The shield absorbs 8 damage.  The
second squad also does 8 damage.  Two points are absorbed by the
rear shield before it collapses.  The remaining 6 are absorbed by
the ship's armor.  The final squad fires, again at the rear
facing of the ship.  This time, with the shield down, the damage
is 3 * 4 = 12 damage.  Three points are absorbed by the ship's
armor (the ship had 9 points of armor on the rear facing).  The
other 9 points are done to the ship's structural integrety.
<P>
<A NAME=bombing><H2>2.7 Bombing</H2><BR>
     Bombs are used to attack ground targets, and can also be
loaded onto Bombers and Heavy Fighters for attacking other ships. 
Bombs always hit their target -- they cannot be jammed, shot
down, or deflected.  Shields and armor, however, do block damage
normally.<BR>
     When loaded onto a ship, bombs have a range of 1 unless the
ship is equipped with transporters.  In the latter case, the
bombs have a range of 12 spaces.  In either case, bombs loaded
onto a WarShip cannot be used to attack other WarShips or any
orbital target.<P>

<A NAME=damage><H2>2.8 Doing Damage</H2>
     Obviously, when a weapon hits its target, it does damage. 
What the damage is done to, and how to handle it, is the subject
of this section.<BR>
     Damage is first done to the ship's shields, specifically a
certain number of points of damage are subtracted from each
individual attack.  The balance is then applied to the shield's
damage absorption capabilities.  With the exception of enveloping
weapons (described in the next section), the damage is done to
whatever facing the weapon strikes.  This is determined by
"drawing" (you don't really need to draw a line on the map --
just use a ruler or some other straightedge) a straight line from
the center of the attacker's hex to the center of the defender's
hex.  The hexside this line passes through determines which table
to roll on to determine what facing to apply the damage to: 
since space is really three dimensional, just because an attack
comes from the front of a ship doesn't mean it hits the front
section.  If the hexside the attack passes through to reach the
defender is the hexside the defender is facing, or the one to
either side, the damage location is rolled on the front facing
table.  If the attack passes through the left rear hexside
adjacent to the left "front" hexside, the damage location is
rolled on the left facing table.  If the attack passes through
the right rear hexside adjacent to the right "front" hexside, the
damage location is rolled on the right facing table.  Finally, if
the attack passes through the rear hexface (the hexface opposite
the front hexface), the damage location is rolled on the rear
facing table.

     Once the shields are down, armor is the next thing to take
damage.  Once a facing's armor is down, structural integrety is
the next.<BR>
     Whenever structural integrety is damaged, there is a chance
an important system will be hit and damaged or destroyed.  This
is called a critial hit, and the chance of a critical is rolled

<P>
     The facing where the critical hit takes place is the same as
the facing that the shot came from.  The actual critical slot hit
is determined randomly, but each slot is equally weighted (so
larger weapons and systems have a greater chance of being
damaged).  The actual dice rolled depends on the number of
critical slots -- that the slot must be chosen randomly is the
only guideline here.<BR>
     If the critical slot hit is empty, no critical hit takes
place -- there wasn't a system at that location.  A repeat hit
has a similar effect:  a destroyed system remains destroyed.
However, some systems can take more than one critical hit...
<P>
     The effects of a critical hit are as follows:
<P>
     A critical hit to a weapon destroys the weapon, taking it
out of commission until repaired.<BR>
     A critical hit to a special device destroys the device,
preventing it from having any further effect on the ship until it
is repaired.<BR>
     A critical hit to the computer destroys it, removing its
beam attack bonus until the computer is repaired.<BR>
     A critical hit to the shield generator damages it, reducing
the recharge rate to half normal.  A second critical hit to the
shield generator destroys it -- the shields go down completely!<BR>
     A critical hit to the engine is very serious.  One critical
hit damages the engine and cuts the ship's combat speed in half.
A second critical hit damages the engine further, immobilizing
the ship and preventing it from entering hyperspace.  A third hit
causes a core breach, destroying the ship and doing damage to
everything around it.  The gruesome details are given below.
<P>
  <B>Example of Damage:</B>  A Medium ship with Tritanium Armor is
struck by four beam blasts from a Heavy Phasor at range 2.  Each
Phasor blast has a base damage of 30 at this range.  The target
ship has a Class III Shield (block 3 damage, absorb 30), 36
points of frontal armor, 18 points of rear armor, and 9 points of
side armor (on each side).  It has 36 SI points.  All of the
blasts come from the front.<BR>
     The attacker rolls hit location for the first beam.  The
result is a 10 -- the right facing is hit.  The right shield
takes 27 damage.  The second location hit is the front (roll of
7).  The front shield takes 27 damage.  The third location hit is
the front again (roll of 7).  The front shield blocks 3 damage
and takes 3 damage before falling.  The remaining 24 points are
applied to the front armor.  The fourth shot also hits the front
(roll of 6).  Since the shield is down, all 30 points get through
to the armor, which has only 12 points left.  The remaining 18
points are done to the ship's SI, and a critical hit roll is
made:  The modifier is +3 for damage, and -2 because the target
ship has Tritanium, for a total modifier of +1.  The roll is a 9
+ 1 = 10, so two critical hits are made!
<P>
<A NAME=marines><H2>2.9 Marines</H2>
     Each size class of ship has a standard complement of marines
as crew.  These marines are basically responsible for running the
ship, and include pilots, navigators, gunners, engineers,
communicators, and doctors.  Many are trained in multiple jobs,
so if one is killed, another can take over until a replacement is
found.<BR>
     Hits by enemy weapons can kill marines.  Every five points
of hard radiation damage that gets past the shields kills a
marine.  Furthermore, every point of normal damage inflicted in a
round has a 1% chance of killing a marine.  If more than 100
damage was inflicted, one marine is automatically killed, and the
rest of the damage is used to calculate the chance another is
killed.  If more than 200 damage is inflicted, two marines are
automatically killed, and the rest of the damage is used to
calculate the change another is killed ... and so on.<BR>
     Shipboard marines are also used in boarding actions against
other ships -- raids and attempts to capture the enemy ship.
Because of this, all of a ship's marines are typically armed with
the best available gear.<BR>
     Without assult shuttles or transports, enemy marines can
only attempt to board an enemy ship that is immobile (unable to
move).  The attacking ship must no more than 1 hex away from the
target ship, and a certain minimum complement must remain on
board the attacking ship if it is remain functional.<BR>
     If the attacker has transporters, a boarding action can be
attempted whenever the defender is 12 or fewer hexes away and the
shield facing in the direction of the attacker is down.  A damper
field will block a transport attempt -- all transporting marines
will be automatically killed.<BR>
     Assult shuttles automatically drop off their marines upon
arriving at the enemy ship (after the enemy ship has had a chance
to fire its point defense weapons).  Assult shuttles can only be
used for capture atttempts, however.  Raids are not permitted
(the marines aren't that suicidal).<BR>
     Marines can be given two missions:  capture or raid.  A
capture attempts to gain control of the enemy ship.  A raid
attempts to destroy systems on board the enemy ship.<BR>
     To capture a ship, the attacking marines must kill or
incapacitate the entire opposing crew.  To conduct a successful
raid, they need only survive a round of crew combat.<BR>
     In order to conduct marine combat each side rolls a d100 and
adds the appropriate combat bonuses for their troops.  This
number is then multiplied by the number of troops in the side.
The winner is the side with the highest number -- casualties are
figured as follows:
<P>
     Every 50 points corresponds to 1 hit of damage.  The winner
adds 1 hit for every 50 points he has more than the loser.  The
loser subtracts 1 hit for every 50 points he has less than the
winner.  Each side divides the number of hits inflicted by the
number of hits each marine has.  The result is the number of
casualties for that side.  What happens next depends on the
purpose of the boarding action.<BR>
     If the attacker's intent was capture, and the entire
defending crew was killed, the attacker has captured the enemy
ship.  If there are still attackers and defenders, both ships may
still act, and the next combat round (at the beginning of the
round) there will be another round of fighting.  It is also
possible for the attacking marines to retreat back to their
vessel if they are able -- they need transporters, assult
shuttles, or their vessel must be no more than 1 hex away.  If
all of the attackers are killed, the defender (obviously) wins,
and retains control of the ship.  If both the attackers and
defenders have all been killed, the ship becomes a derelict.  The
winner of the fight can pick it up after the combat, or someone
can attempt to board and hold it. <BR>
     A captured ship can only be immediately controlled by a
telepathic race.  Such a race can mind-control some of the
defending marines into running the ship.  If the race isn't
telepathic, the victorious marines will need some time to figure
out how to work the ship; they will not be able to use the ship
until the combat is over.  If the side that captured the ship
loses the combat or retreats, the captured ship reverts to the
origional owner unless the marines on board were telepathic and
made the ship retreat.  If the original owner recaptures the ship
during that combat, he/she may immediately take control of it.
If the original owner recaptures the ship in a later combat, he
too must wait until the end of the battle to be able to use the
ship (the captors needed to make a few adjustments to run the
ship, so it's controls are no longer quite familiar to the
original race) ... unless, of course, the original owner is also
telepathic.<BR>
     If the attacker's intent was a raid, any marines that
survive the combat attack the ship's internal systems.  Roll
1d100 again and add the attacker's bonuses.  Multiply again by
the number of attacking marines left.  Every 50 points is 1
automatic critical hit against the enemy ship -- randomly
determined.  If the criticals destroy the engine, the attacking
marines are killed as the ship explodes unless they have
transporters.  In the latter case, they simply transport back to
their ship.  Otherwise, a raid always ends with the attacking
marines returning to their vessel.  One very important note:  one
defending marine will always survive the raid unless the ship is
destroyed.  This is because at least 1 defending marine was
piloting the ship instead of fighting during the raid.

    <B>Example of Marine Combat:</B> An enemy crusier (large) has been
immobilized by fusion beam fire from an attacking destroyer
(medium).  The destroyer moves to within 1 hex of the crusier,
and sends in 6 of its eight marines on a raiding mission.  The
raiders have Tritanium Powered Armor, Personal Shields, and Laser
Rifles (+45 combat bonus, 2 hits).  The defending ship has 11
marines left, each with Tritanium Armor and Fusion Rifles (+20
combat bonus, 1 hit).  The raiders roll a 90.  (90 + 45)   6
equals 810.  The defenders roll a 2 (bad day to be a defender).
(2 + 20)   11 equals 242.  The difference is 568, so the attacker
adds 11 hits, and the defender subtracts 11 hits!  This means the
attacker doesn't even take a wound, and the defender is
slaughtered to a man (except for the one marine left piloting the
ship).  The attacker then rolls again getting a 51.  (51 + 45)
6 equals 576, so the attacker inflicts 11 critical hits to the
enemy ship!  One of these turns out to be an engine critical, so
the ship explodes, killing all of the raiders!  Bad day to be a
raider too...
<P>
     Marines are, however, vital crew members, and having them
killed in raids, capture attempts, and by weapon strikes isn't
good for the ship.  Each size ship has a minimum complement below
which it suffers penalties to combat speed (with corresponding
penalties to ship defense) and ship attack.  The table below
lists the normal complement for a ship, the minimum, and the
penalties applied for each marine the ship is below the minimum.
Of, course, if all of the marines are killed, the ship becomes a
derelict.  Derelicts are considered immobile for boarding and
ship defense purposes.

<H1><CENTER>Chapter III - Weapons and Special Systems</CENTER></H1>
     This section covers, in detail, the weapons and special
systems that can be placed onboard a warship.
<P>
<A NAME=weapsys><H2>3.1 General Considerations</H2>
     All weapons and systems require a certain amount of space
and critical slots.  The latter is related to the former:  to get
the number of critical slots needed for a weapon or system,
divide the space required for the system by 10 and round
normally.<P>
     Furthermore, weapons that take up less than 10 space can be
combined into weapons pods.  Weapons pods simulaneously aim and
fire a group of weapons at a single target.  All of the weapons
must be of the same type, with the same modifications, and only
one attack roll is made.  If the roll hits, all of the weapons
hit.  If it misses, all of the weapons miss.  Finally, since the
pod takes up only one critical space, a hit to that critical
space destroys all the weapons in the pod.  The maximum amount of
space in a single weapons pod is 14.<BR>
     For example, a fully miniturized laser with no modifications
requires 2.5 space.  Five lasers together would require 12.5
space (which rounds up to 13).  So a weapons pod with five of
these lasers would require 1 critical slot and 13 space.
     Special systems can also be crammed into single critical
slots.  Each system must take up 5 space or less, and the total
amount of space can be no greater than 14.  Like weapons pods, a
critical to that slot destroys all of the systems in the slot.
<P>
     All weapons and many special systems can be miniturized.
Miniturization reduces the size and cost of these systems, and is
based on the number of fields researched beyond the weapon's own
field.<BR>
     In order to determine miniturization effects, use the tables
in this section to compare the race's "tech level" in the
appropriate field to the weapon's or the system's "tech level".
The race "tech level" minus the system's "tech level" is the #
Fields Beyond in the following table.

<P>
<A NAME=beamweap><H2>3.2 Beam Weapons</H2>
     Beam weapons fire focused, coherant beams of photons,
subatomic particles, or plasma.  The beam usually does damage
with its incredable heat and highly focused impact point.  All
beam weapons have a problem with range dissipation -- the
tendency for beams to lose coherance over distance.  This causes
beam weapons to do less damage the further away the target is.
Also, distant targets are harder to hit, so beam weapons have a
to-hit penalty with range.
<P>
     There are several modifications that can be applied to beam
weapons that affect their performance.
<P>
    <B>Heavy Mount</B> weapons are larger, more powerful versions of
normal beam weapons.  They produce a more energetic, more
coherant beam, although their large size makes it impossible to
target missiles and fighters.  A Heavy Mount weapon has twice the
range of a normal weapon, a 50% bonus to damage, and suffers half
the normal damage penalties with range.  The weapon requires
twice the space and cost of a normal weapon.  The Heavy Mount and
Point Defense modifications are mutually exclusive.
<P>
    <B>Point Defense</B> weapons are smaller, more accurate versions of
normal beam weapons used to target incoming missiles and
fighters.  Point Defense weapons do only 50% the normal amount of
damage, and have double the range penalties for damage.  They,
however, are more precise, and have +25% to their to-hit
percentage.  Point Defense weapons are 50% the size and cost of a
normal weapon.  They require the intended weapon to have
undergone 1 level of miniturization, and are exclusive with Heavy
Mount weapons.
<P>
     <B>Continuous Fire</B> weapons are able to maintain their beam
longer without overheating.  This improves their accuracy by
+25%, and increases their damage by 10%.  The extra space
required for advanced focusing equipment and heat controls
increase the size and cost of the weapon by 50%.  The
modification requires the intended weapon to have undergone 1
level of miniturization.
<P>
    <B>Pulse Fire</B> weapons have rapidly recharging capacitors and
more advanced heat control systems.  As a result, a pulse weapon
fires three rapid, full-strength shots rather than one.  Because
the battle computer doesn't have as long to calculate its
target's position and movement, there is a -20% penalty to
accuracy.  Furthermore, there is no time to adjust the weapon
position between shots -- they either all hit or miss, so only
one attack roll is required.  This modification requires the
intended weapon to have undergone 2 levels of miniturization and
adds 50% to the weapon's size and cost.
<P>
    <B>Armor Piercing</B> weapons use powerful focusing elements to
greatly confine the beam width.  This narrow beam is barely
dissipated by armor, so the beam cuts through as if the armor
wasn't there and does damage directly to the ship's SI.  Of
coure, the beam is still vulnerable to deflector shields, and
even armor piercing beams cannot penetrate Xentronium or any
Heavy Armor.  This modification requires 1 level of
miniturization, and increases the size and cost of the weapon by
50%.
<P>
    <B>Shield Piercing</B> weapons use charge masking, phase
variations, or both to make the beam "invisible" to a target's
shields.  These weapons ignore a target's shield completely,
unless the target has a Hard Shield installed.  This modification
requires 1 level of miniturization, and increases the size and
cost of the weapon by 50%.
<P>
    <B>Enveloping</B> beam weapons surround the target on impact and
inflict their damage on all four facings.  Any damage from any
facing that penetrates the armor does damage to the SI of the
ship.  Enveloping increases the size and cost of a weapon by
100%, and require the intended weapon to have undergone 2 levels
of miniturization.
<P>
    <B>No Range Dissipation</B> weapons use advanced focusers and power
boosters to eliminate a beam's damage penalty with range.  This
modification increases the size and cost of the weapon by 25%,
and requires the intended weapon to have undergone 1 level of
miniturization.
<P>
    <B>Hard Radiation</B> beams are deadly to living tissue.  Every 5
points of damage that penetrates the target's shields kills one
marine on board the ship.  Only a Damper Field can block this
effect.
<P>
    <B>Electromagnetic Pulse</B> generate powerful bursts of
electromagnetic energy.  These weapons damage shields normally,
but ignore a ship's armor.  Every 5 damage they do to internal
structure results in an automatic critical hit as the lethal
blasts of electromagnetic energy fry internal systems.
<P>
    <B>Gravitic</B> weapons generate enormously powerful tidal forces
in the interior of the ship.  This shearing force results in
extra internal damage:  a strike to the ship's armor also does
50% damage directly to the ship's SI (no chance of criticals).
Any damage that penetrates the armor does double damage to the
ship's structure.  For example, two gravitic beams strike a ship
with 16 armor points for 10 damage each.  The first beam does 10
damage to the armor and 5 to the SI.  The second beam does 6
damage to the armor and 11 to the SI (6ö2 + 4 2 = 11).
<P>
    <B>Double Range Dissipation</B> weapons lose conherance quickly
with distance.  As a result, these weapons have double the normal
range penalties with distance.
<P>
    <B>Automatic Hit</B> weapons have such a wide field of effect that
there is no need to roll for a hit -- the weapon always strikes
its target.
<P>
    <B>Planet Busters</B> are weapons capable of generating a burst of
energy powerful enough to reduce a world to an asteroid belt!

<P>
     <B>Laser Cannons</B> are the most basic beam weapons.  Laser is an
acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of
radiation.  A laser beam is a stream of coherant, same-wavelength
photons.  The beam can be tightly focused and easily modified and
amplified, allowing for pulse fire, continuous fire, armor
piercing, and no range dissipation.
<P>
    <B>Fusion Beams</B> fire focused beams of superheated fusion
plasma.  Fusion beams have low coherance, and as such have double
the range penalties for damage.  Added heat sinks allow for
continuous fire, and, like all plasma weapons, fusion beams can
be made enveloping.
<P>
    <B>Neutron Beams</B>, in spite of the name, fire focused beams of
both neutrons and alpha particles.  The latter are used in the
reaction to create and accelerate the neutrons -- the chargeless
neutrons are very difficult to focus and accelerate alone.  Added
heat sinks allow for continuous fire, and neutron radiation is a
very penetrating form of hard radiation.
<P>
     <B>Ion Cannons</B> fire focused pulses of alternating protons and
electrons that generate an extremely powerful current across the
beam and in the target.  The currents created by this weapon
cascade through the target's armor, damaging both internal
systems and internal structure.  Ion Cannons are large and
unweildy weapons -- they can be given the continuous fire
modification with some localized heat dissipation equipment, but
they are too big to make into heavy mount weapons:  the resulting
syncotron radiation would be lethal to the ship's crew.
Likewise, they cannot be made into point defense weapons since
that would reduce the particle accelerator's size too much.
<P>
     <B>Graviton Beams</B> fire narrow a narrow, intense stream of
gravitons that set up a tremendous shearing force across their
target.  This shearing force has a devistating effect on a ship's
structural integrety.  Any damage to the armor does 50% damage to
the structure as well (no chance of critical).  Any damage
directly to structure is doubled (with chance of critical).
Graviton beams can be built as a large platform weapon, but the
difficulty inherant in creating intense graviton fields
(gravitons are, individually, extreme weak force carriers) makes
point defense graviton beams ineffective.
<P>
     <B>Phasors</B> fire intense, coherant streams of visible, UV, and
X-ray radiation simultaneously in normal and hyperspace.  Because
they are similar, in principle, to a laser, phasors can be
modified as point defense, heavy mount, continuous, and pulse
weapons.  Their "multi-phased" component however, allows them to
skirt a target's shields with only a few modifications.  However,
the difficulty of increasing coherance simultaneously in normal
and hyperspace rules out the No Range Dissipation mod.
<P>
     <B>Plasma Cannons</B> are devistating, high-yeild plasma weapons
that utilize a combination of fusion and matter-antimatter
reactions to generate a powerful and naturally enveloping blast
of superheated plasma.  Like fusion beams, plasma cannons can be
made continuous.  While it is rather easy to scale them up to a
heavy mount, the bulkiness of all the required heat dissipation
equipment makes a point defense version very impractical.  And,
like all plasma weapons, plasma cannons have severe coherance
problems that double the range penalties to damage.
<P>
     <B>Mauler Devices</B> are tremendous, brute-force energy cannons
with a very wide spread.  A mauler blast always strikes its
target, but the damage dissipation due to range is doubled -- a
tradeoff for the wide spread attribute.  Maulers can be scaled up
to a heavy platform, but the energy generators required are
simply too large to allow for point defense modifications.
<P>
     <B>The Stellar Converter</B> is the pinnacle in plasma weapon
research.  This awesome cannon uses a city block's worth of
plasma collectors, fusion generators, capacitors, and heat
dissipators to launch a ship-sized stream of super-dense plasma
heated to ten billion degrees Celsius!  The devistating blast
envelops the target, automatically doing 400 damage to each
facing!  The density of the plasma stream precludes dissipation
with range as well.<BR>
     Furthermore, a Stellar Converter can, over the course of
several hours (during which the ship cannot engage in any
activities save for minor orbital corrections and generating
nominal life support) build its plasma banks up to a million
times normal density and a thousand times normal temperature.
Although the weapon must be fired immediately, the focused plasma
stream can melt a planet's crust and mantle, and set up a
shockwave in the core that rips the world apart!  A few hours
after the planet's destruction, the debris will cool and coelesce
into an asteroid field.
<P>
     <B>Death Rays</B> are legendary weapons reputed to have once been
developed by the Orions.  Although no known extant race in the
galaxy has replicated this technology, there are plenty of
records about them.  Death rays strike their target with the
force of a Mauler device, and the radiation they carry is quite
lethal to living tissue.  Legend has it that a single strike by a
death ray could leave a ship a drifting derelict -- the ship may
survive, but the radiation would instantly kill the crew!
<P>
     <B>Particle Beams</B> are another legendary weapon of the Orions.
Smaller than death rays, particle beams were reputed to have been
naturally shield piercing.  Little else is known about them.
<P>
<A NAME=ballistic><H2>3.3 Ballistic Weapons</H2>
     Ballistic weapons fire slugs, shells, and other projectiles
at their target.  They rely on the kinetic energy of their
ordinance to damage the target.  Because kinetic energy is not
dissipated as the slugs travel through space, ballistic weapons
do not suffer a range-based penalty to damage.  They do, however,
suffer a to-hit penalty based on range, just like beam weapons.<BR>
     Ballistic weapons also differ from beam weapons in that they
require ammunition.  Once a ballistic weapon runs out of ammo, it
cannot be fired until it has been reloaded (usually at a friendly
colony or star base).  The ammo number listed in the table is the
number of shots the weapon emplacement itself holds.  Every 10
space (1 critical) allocated to extra armor increases a weapon's
available ammo by twice the amount listed under ammo.<BR>
     Ballistic weapons can have the following modifications:
<P>
    <B>Heavy Mount</B> ballistic weapons are large platform versions of
normal ballistic weapons.  The increased size and speed of the
projectile boosts the weapon's damage by 50% and gives it a
maximum range of 48 spaces.  Heavy mount increases the size and
cost of a weapon by 100%.
<P>
     <B>Point Defense</B> weapons are small, precise copies of the
normal weapon often used to target incoming fighters and
missiles.  Point defense ballistic weapons do half normal damage
and have a maximum range of 12.  They are also half the size and
cost of normal ballistic weapons.  Point defense requires
<P>
     <B>Autofire</B> weapons use rapid loading technology to fire off
three slugs in one round.  Because the battle computer doesn't
have as much time to target the shot, there is a -20% to the Hit
%.  Also, since all of the slugs are fired without a chance to
adjust the weapon's aim, a single roll is all that is required:
a miss indicates all three shots miss -- a hit means all three
shots hit.  Naturally, firing the weapon uses three rounds of
ammo.  Autofire weapons have a 50% increase in size and cost, and
autofire isn't available until the weapon has undergone two
levels of miniturization.
<P>
     <B>Armor Piercing</B> weapons use particularly fast and heavy
shells to rip through a target ship's armor.  An armor piercing
weapon penetrates all forms of armor except for Xenotronium or
Heavy Armor.  Armor Piercing increases a weapon's size and cost
by 50% and is not available until the intended weapon has
undergone 1 level of miniturization.

<P>     
     <B>Autocannons</B> use chemical charges to propel explosive shells
at their target.  The real engineering feat of these weapons is
the use of extremely advanced chemical charges.  8"Autocannons
use a standard chemical explosive (in rather large quantities).
The 14" version uses Merculite explosives.  The 20"Autocannon use
a charge based on molecular compression (the same "charge" that
is used by a Pulson missile).  These are necessary to propel the
warhead at a velocity high enough to give it a range comprable to
other beam and ballistic weapons.<BR>
     Autocannons are rated by the size of the shell:  a
14"Autocannon fires a 14-inch diameter shell.  With proper
miniturization, rapid loaders and armor-piercing shells can
significantly improve an autocannon's performance.  Autocannons
cannot be scaled up or down -- A scaled down 8"Autocannon
wouldn't be able to fire a 8" shell!  And a scaled up version
would simply be inefficient (better to use a bigger shell).
<P>     
     <B>Mass Drivers</B> are electromagnetic railguns that fire hyper-
velocity iron projectiles.  They are rather easy to scale up or
down, and can be modified for autofire and armor piercing rounds.
<P>     
    <B>Gauss Cannons</B> are extremely powerful linear accelerators
that hurl massive bursts of tiny projectiles at close to the
speed of light.  Like their smaller cousins (the mass drivers),
gauss cannons can be modified for a heavy mount platform.  They
can also be given an autofire ammunition loading system, and
armor piercing ordinance.  They cannot, however, be modified for
point defense -- the miniturization for this weapon just doesn't
kick in fast enough to make this mod viable.
<P>     
    <B>Disruptor</B> cannons are strange beasts.  A disruptor generates
a massive, directed surge in the local "zero-point" energy of
space itself.  The result is a tight, cohesive region of much
higher than normal energy that travels at the speed of light
toward its target.  Upon striking the target, the zero-point
energy surge is converted directly into kinetic energy, often
explosively vaporizing anything it hits.  While the region of
energy "disruption" is itself totally invisible, one interesting
side effect is an extreme "blue-shifting" of the natural
microwave background photons to the green part of the spectrum.
This generates a brilliant green glow in the region of energy
disruption, acting as a natural tracer for the disruptor blast!<BR>
     Disruptors are very complex weapons.  As such, they cannot
be scaled down enough for a point defense platform, although they
can most certainly be scaled up to heavy mount.  A disruptor can
also be equipped with a rapidly recharging energy inducer,
allowing the weapon to be fired in an "autofire" mode.<BR>
     Although in some respects a disruptor is much like a beam
weapon, the total lack of range dissipation and the fact that it
is (technically) kinetic energy that is used to destroy the
target leads to its classification as a ballistic weapon.  In any
case, a disruptor doesn't use or need ammo.
<BR>     
     <B>The Annihilator</B> is another legendary weapon developed by the
Orions.  This powerful weapon's "ammo" was nothing less than a
miniature black hole!  This "quantum singularity" was generated
in the weapon's vaccuum chamber, and accelerated at close to the
speed of light out of the gunnel.  The gravitational riptides
created by this awesome weapon were augmented by the short
lifetime of the black hole.  The hole would return its "formation
energy" to the cosmos within a second, generating an explosion in
the process.
<P>
<A NAME=missiles><H2>3.4 Missiles and Torpedoes</H2>
     Missiles are guided drones that carry a high-explosive
warhead to their target.  Torpedoes use magnetic containment
fields to hold volatile materials.  The containment field
ruptures when the torpedo strikes its target, causing an
explosion.<BR>
     Unless they are jammed, both missiles and torps always hit
their target.  They, typically, suffer no reduction to their
damage from range.<BR>
     The standard emplacement of a missile has enough ammo to
fire the missile five times.  Every ten additional shots requires
10 space and 1 critical to be allocated for the missiles.  Ammo
for missiles never miniturizes . . . although the missile
emplacement itself does.  Missiles can be targeted by point
defense and normal-sized weapons.  Each missile requires a
certain number of "hits" to be inflicted on it before it is
destroyed.  Also, a single beam blast can destroy no more than
one missile per shot.  The one exception is the Mauler device.
Maulers, by virtue of the fact that they produce a very wide
angle blast, can damage every missile in the target hex.  A
normal-sized Mauler destroys (Mauler damage/Missile "hits")
missiles.<BR>
     Torpedoes do not require ammo; they require one full turn to
recharge before they can fire again.  Also, torps cannot be shot
down, they can only be jammed.<BR>
     The following modifications can be applied to missiles and
torpedoes:
<P>
     <B>Multiple Independantly targetable Re-Entry Vehicle</B> missiles
each carry four full-strength warheads that separate from the
delivery vehicle just before impact.  These warheads can be
targeted to either all hit the same facing, or each to hit one
facing.  Note, however, that the warheads do not have to be
targeted invididually:  if the missile is jammed or destroyed,
all of the warheads are lost.  This modification increases the
size and cost of the missiles by 100%, and is only possible after
the missiles have undergone 2 levels of miniturization.
<P>
     <B>Electronic Counter Countermeasures</B> are electrical targeting
and retargeting systems that aid a missile or torpedo in
retaining its lock on a target that is attempting to jam its
guidance computer.  ECCM projectiles halve the effect of the
target's jamming device.  They add 25% to the size and cost of
the projectile, and require it to have undergone 1 level of
miniturization.
<P>
     <B>Heavily Armored</B> missiles use the race's best researched
armor to protect the warheads, greatly increasing the amount of
damage needed to destroy the projectile.  The bonus to the
missile's "hits" are equal to the bonus normally provided by the
armor.  For example, a Nuclear Missile (4 hits) armored with
Zortrium (+12 hits) will withstand 16 damage.  This modification
adds 25% to the size and cost of the missile, and requires the
missile to have undergone 1 level of miniturization.
<P>
     <B>Fast missiles</B> and torpedoes have a +8 bonus to their combat
speed.  This also adds 40 to a missile's defense rating against
defensive weapons.  The fast modification adds 25% to the
projectile's size and cost, and requires 1 level of
miniturization.
<P>
     <B>Emissions Guidance</B> missiles track the waste "trail" produced
by a ship's engines in combat and follow it right up the target's
tailpipe.  This can have devistating effects if the missile hits:
the missile automatically ignores the target's armor, there is a
+2 to the critical hit roll (normal damage modifiers apply), and
all critical hits are to the ship's engines.  EMG missiles are
only available to races with EMG technology.  Because the mod
requires a very advanced guidance, targeting, and manuvering
system for the missile, it increases the size and cost of the
missile by 4 times.
<P>
     <B>Overloaded</B> torpedoes use a more powerful containment field
to hold a much larger explosive payload.  Even then, the payload
almost always exceeds their engineering safety limits, requiring
extra shielding and fail-safe equipment in the loaders and
torpedo tubes.  As a result, overloaded increases the damage done
by a torpedo by 50%, but increases the size and cost by 25%.  The
torpedo must have undergone 2 levels of miniturization for this
modification to be applicable.
<P>
     <B>Enveloping</B> torpedoes surround their target on impact, doing
their damage to all four of the target's facings.  Any damage
from any facing that penetrates the armor is inflicted to the SI
normally.  The enveloping modification adds 100% to the torpedo's
size and cost, and requires that the weapon have undergone 2
levels of miniturization.
<P>
     <B>No Range Dissipation</B> strengthens the stability of a plasma
torpedo enough so that it doesn't lose strength as it travels.
This mod increases the size and cost of the weapon by 25%, and
requires 1 level of miniturization.

<P>
     <B>Nuclear Missiles</B> are the most basic type of missile
available.  These weapons use the atomic fission of a small
amount of uranium to do their damage.
<P>
     <B>Merculite Missiles</B> use a powerful chemical explosive dubbed
Merculite for their warhead.  Merculite warheads are more
efficient than uranium warheads, releasing about 60% more energy
per gram.
<P>
     <B>Pulson Missiles</B> use molecular compression technology to
generate a powerful explosion.
<P>
     <B>Zeon Missiles</B>, the most powerful type yet developed, use the
strange chemical and atomic properties of Zeon, the only trans-
uranic "noble-gas" ever discovered.
<P>
     <B>Antimatter Torpedoes</B> confine a tiny amount of antimatter in
a strong magnetic field.  When the torpedo strikes its target,
the antimatter reacts with the matter in the target to create a
very powerful explosion.
<P>
     <B>Proton Torpedoes</B> are powerful, dense clouds of high-energy
protons confined within a magnetic field.  These projectiles
travel at nearly the speed of light, allowing them to reach their
target instantly.  Once there, the magnetic field ruptures,
allowing the protons to blast their way through the ship.
<P>
     <B>Plasma Torpedoes</B> use a powerful force field to confine a
dense, 10 million degree plasma.  The projectile is very
unstable, and the energy bleed-off necessesary to maintain the
force field's containment reduces the damage the torpedo does by
5 points for every hex travelled.
<P>
<A NAME=fightcraft><H2>3.5 Fighter Craft</H2>
     Fighters are small, short-range, one or two man combat
craft.  Fighters are typically equipped with one or two short
range weapons, the best armor available, and a limited supply of
fuel and power.<BR>
     Fighters lack hyperspacial capabilities, but their small
size makes them extremely quick and manuverable.  Fighters are
rearmed and repaired in the hangers of larger WarShips, where
they are launched at specific targets.  Fighters are hangered and
launched in squadrons of 4, and the fighters in a squad move and
attack in unison.<BR>
     Fighters do not miniturize, although a race with a tech
level higher than the fighter's tech level may be able to modify
the fighters somewhat.  A fighter has a certain number of "hits"
-- the damage a fighter can take before it is destroyed.  This is
further modified by the best armor available to the race, as
follows:

<P>
     Fighters are vulnerable to the effects of armor piercing
weapons (ignore the effects of armor's modifier to "hits") and
shield piercing weapons (igore the shield, if the fighter has
one).<BR>
     The following mods are applicable:
<P>
     <B>Shielded</B> fighters are equipped with a small version of the
best shield available to the race.  The shield blocks damage
normally, and can absorb damage equal to its rating before
falling.  The shield, like the fighter, however, is considered to
have only one facing.  For example, a shielded fighter with a
Class III Shield can block 3 damage from each attack, and absorb
a total of 3 damage before the shield falls.  Equipping a fighter
with shielding requires 1 level of research be done beyond the
fighter's tech level, and increases the fighter's size and cost
by 50%.
<P>
     <B>Fast</B> fighters are equipped with powerful afterburners and
extra fuel that give them a combat speed bonus of +8, and a
defense bonus of +40.  This modification requires 1 level of
research beyond the fighter's tech level, and increases the
fighter's size and cost by 25%.
<P>
     <B>Assult Equipped</B> fighters replace the normal point defense
weapons with a normal sized version of the best beam or ballistic
weapon available to the race (i.e. the weapon with the highest
tech level) with a size of 10 or less, taking miniturization in
account.  This reduces the Hit % for the fighter by 25.  This mod
cuts the number of beam strikes the fighter can make in half,
however, and adds 50% to the fighter's size and cost.  It also
requires 2 levels of research beyond the fighter's tech level.
This modification is exclusive with Fully Modified fighters.
<P>
     <B>Fully Modified</B> fighters use the most advanced version of the
point defense beam or ballistic weapon available (i.e. the weapon
with the highest tech level), and adds all the possible mods (any
modifiers to the Hit % are applicable).  This increases the cost
and size of the fighter by 50%, and requires 2 levels of research
beyond the fighter's tech level.  Fully Modified fighters cannot
also be Assult Equipped.
<P>
     <B>Hornets</B> are small, computer controlled versions of an
Interceptor.  Hornets are smaller and faster than an Interceptor
(although they are still added in squads of four), with only two
hits (modified by armor), and a +4 to combat speed and +20 to
defense.  They still use point-defense weapons, but only have
enough energy to fire twice before needing to return to the
carrier.  This modification requires 2 levels of research beyond
the fighter's tech level, and reduces the size and cost of the
fighter by 50%.  Hornets cannot be Assult Equipped or Shielded
(they are too small for normal-sized weapons or a shield
generator).

<P>
     <B>Interceptors</B> are small, short ranged fighters equipped with
a single point defense version of the best beam weapon available
to the race, and enough energy and fuel to fire the weapon four
times before returning to the carrier.  The Interceptor platform
is very versitile and is easily modified, allowing for the
addition of shields, high energy afterburners, and full-sized
beam weapons or fully-modified point defense weapons.  They can
also be scaled down and controlled by an AI.
<P>
     <B>Assult Shuttles</B> are slow, cramped combat craft.  Although
unarmed, each assult shuttle carries 1 marine and his or her
necessary equipment.  Upon reaching the target, the marine docks
the assult shuttle with the enemy vessel and enters, attempting
to capture the enemy ship (often with fellows from other assult
shuttles in the squad).  Only capture is possible -- missions to
raid the ship's systems are too risky to the marines and the
shuttles.  Assult Shuttles can be given shields and afterburners.
<P>
     <B>Bombers</B> are much heavier, slower versions of the Interceptor
craft, armed with the best bombs available to the race.  A bomber
can drop up to two bombs (one each round) before needing to
return to the carrier to reload.  Bombs always strike their
target.  Bombers can be equipped with both shields and
afterburners.
<P>
     <B>Heavy Fighters</B>. These powerful fighter craft are heavily
armored, and carry two point defense versions of the best
available beam weapon, and two of the best bombs available to the
race.  Upon reaching its target, a heavy fighter fires both beam
weapons and drops a bomb.  It can repeat this the next round, and
then needs to return to the carrier for reloading, rearming, and
repairs.  Like an Interceptor, the Heavy Fighter platform lends
itself well to modification.  In addition to a shield generator
and an afterburner, a heavy fighter can be either assult equipped
or carry fully modified versions of its point defense beams.
<P>
<A NAME=bombs&bio><H2>3.6 Bombs and Biological Weapons</H2>
     Bombs and biologicals represent a very powerful class of
weapons designed to target colonies and other ground
instillations.  Bombs and bio weapons tend to be very light and
compact, and yet have tremendous destructive potential.  The
tradeoff is accuracy; bomb-type weapons do not carry any form of
guidance or targeting capability, so they are only effective
against very large targets where collateral damage is important.<BR>
     Each bomb/bioweapon emplacement in the ship holds 10 bombs,
and has one drop chute.  Bombs, like missiles and ballistics,
require ammo.  Extra ammo for a specific bomb chute is allocated
in 10 space increments.  The specific amount of ammo depends on
the bomb.<BR>
     Bombs have a maximum range of 1 space, and automatically hit
their target, doing a random amount of damage (the "damage" done
to a colony depends on the strategic value of where the bomb
actually hits).  Bio weapons are a similar ball game, but their
method of damage is described below.<BR>
     A transporter system can greatly facilitate the delivery of
bombs or bio weapons to a planetary target.  A transporter-
equipped ship can deliver a bomb or biological weapon payload to
a planetary target from up to 12 hexes away!<BR>
     Biological weapons deserve special mention because of their
method for doing damage.  Each biological weapon dropped on a
world automatically kills a certain percentage of the population,
listed under damage.  Multiple drops are figured as follows:<BR>
     With each drop, there is less population to kill, and a
greater number that will be resistant to the bio weapon.  Each
drop, however, does have a minimum number of population per drop
that can die -- so it is possible to totally kill of a population
with a bio weapon.<BR>
     Use the following formula to calculate the number of
survivors after x number of drops:
<P>
<B>No. survivors = Total Population   [1 - (% Killed ö 100)] ^ No. Drops</B><BR>
<B>Min No. Killed = Min strength   number of drops</B>
<P>
     The actual number killed is <B>Total Population - No.
survivors</B>.  If this is less than Min No. Killed, then use Min No.
Killed as the number of population killed and determine the
casualties from the attack.
<P>
     For example, a race uses death spores (2% Killed) on a
colony with a population of 11 million.  Death Spores have a Min
No. Killed = 80,000 people/drop.  During the course of the fight,
the race drops 20 death spores on their target:
<P>
No. survivors = 11 million   [.98] ^ 20 = 7.3 million<BR>
Min No. Killed = 80 thousand   20 = 2.4 million
<P>
     The actual number killed was (11 million - 7.3 million = )
3.7 million people, which is higher than 2.4 million, so the Min
No. Killed is ignored.
<P>
     Bombs and biological weapons do not have, need, or use
modifications.

<P>
     <B>Nuclear Bombs</B> are unguided, high-yield explosive devices
designed to destroy instillations and ground forces.  The
explosion derives from the uncontrolled fission of Uranium or
Plutonium, and inflicts 3-12 damage.
<P>
     <B>Fusion Bombs</B> generate a more-efficient explosion than
Nuclear Bombs by runaway fusion of Hydrogen nuclei into Helium.
This increases the damage per bomb to 4-24 damage.
<P>
     <B>Antimatter Bombs</B> each hold a few grams of antimatter in a
powerful magnetic containment field.  When the bomb hits its
target, the magnetic field ruptures, releasing the antimatter.
This antimatter reacts violently with normal matter, generating a
powerful explosion that does 8-40 damage.
<P>
     <B>Neutronium Bombs</B> are the most powerful and advanced
explosive devices ever devised.  A Neutronium Bombs releases a
super-dense, degenerate substance onto its target.  The resulting

compression/implosion does 10-60 damage to the target.
<P>
     <B>Death Spores</B> are a henious, genetically-engineered
retrovirus with a very short incubation period and a very high
mortality rate.  The virus is extremely contageous, and is
delivered to the target on fungal "spores" engineered to spread
easily (on clothing, in the water supply, and through the air)
throughout the colony.  Each dose of this virus dropped on a
colony kills 2% of the population, with diminishing returns for
each subsequent dose.  In any case, however, the virus is
virulent enough to kill 80,000 people.
<P>
     <B>Bio Terminators</B> are one of the most hideous organisms ever
developed.  Based on the study of a particularly deadly, but non-
sentient, alien life form first encountered by the Meklar, the
Bio-Terminator is really a kind of "dual-species".  An adult
"Bio-Terminator" is an eight foot long, heavily-armored,
insectiod killing machine with long, powerful claws and a whip-
like, segmented tail.  However, the embryo for this adult form is
carried by a parasitic organism that resembles a cross between a
crab and a spider.  This organism is commonly referred to as the
"larval" stage, and a DNA analysis would confirm that the larval
stage and the adult are simply two totally distinct expressions
of the Terminator's compete genetic code.<BR>
     The "larval" stage is nocturnal, and very adept at ambushing
isolated prey.  The larva attaches to the face of its victim,
providing oxygen and nutrients to its host, but inducing coma and
snaking an ovipositor down the victim's throat.  When the
ovipositor reaches the victim's chest region, it deposits an
embryo of the "adult" form, that is then fed by the larva.  This
process totally depletes the larval form of energy -- it
separates from its victim after about twelve hours, crawls off
and dies.  The victim remains in a coma for about one hour before
returning to consciousness with no memory of anything that has
happened for the past twenty-four to fourty-eight hours.<BR>
     In the mean time, the embryo rapidly grows inside its victim
for about twelve more hours.  It then tears its way out of the
victim's chest, killing the victim and providing the new "adult"
bio-terminator with it's first meal.  This provides the energy
needed to, in less than twelve hours, grow to full adulthood.<BR>
     The fully-grown bio terminator hunts, kills and eats
indescriminantly to provide the energy it needs to lay the tough,
leathery eggs that birth the larva form.  It will also attempt to
capture and cacoon some victims near its eggs to allow the larvae
easy access to more hosts.  A single bio terminator in a
populated area can hunt and kill up to 40 people in one day --
with each kill providing the energy it needs to lay one egg.
Also, unlike an infection, a bio terminator can easily seek out a
new location if its food source becomes scarce.<BR>
     A single drop of these creatures, consisting of seven
storage canisters with the larval form inside, will kill 4% of
the population, or at least 150,000 people, before the
infestation can be brought under control.  Multiple drops are not
as effective percentage wise, although each drop will still kill
a minimum of 150,000 people.

</TABLE>

<P>
     <B>Gyro Destabilizers</B> create a temorary hyperspacial field on
one facing of the ship, greatly reducing the inertia over a
portion of the ship.  This greatly magnifies the natural torques
and spin on the ship and has two combat worthy effects.  First,
it spins the ship like a dervish until the hyperspacial field
dissipates (after about 2 or 3 seconds).  This has the affect of
changing the ship's orientation by 1-6 hexfaces to the left.
Second, as regions of the ship pass from the hyperspacial field
back into "normal" space, the intertia is abruptly restored to
normal.  This creates tremendous shearing across the ship that
does 1-4 damage times the size class of the ship (i.e. 1 for
small, 2 for medium, 3 for large, etc.).  The Destabilizer has a
range of 15 hexes.
<P>
     <B>Anti-Missile Rockets</B> are small missiles designed
specifically to target and destroy incoming missiles.  They act
as point defense weapons, but only have a maximum range of 9
hexes.  Each rocket fired has a 95% chance, -10% per hex
travelled, of destroying an incoming missile.  Each AMR launcher
has enough ammo for 20 shots.
<P>
     <B>Pulsars</B> create a powerful, expanding harmonic resonance
field that sets up violent vibrations in any ship within 6 hexes.
The expanding field itself is blocked by deflector shields and
armor, so it must bring down a ship's shield first, and then the
armor before doing any damage to the ship's internal structure
and systems.  A pulsar does 1-12 * 2 damage to the target,
multiplied by the target's size class.  It hits the facing
closest to the attacking ship.  The damage to a fighter or
missile is 1-12.
<P>
     <B>Tractor Beams</B> create a powerful gravitic field around the
target ship designed to hamper any movement.  A tractor
automatically hits its target, and reduces its combat speed by 10
divided by the size class of the ship (round normally).  The
ship's defense rating goes down by 5 per movement point lost.
Multiple tractor beams are cumulative, and a ship with a combat
speed reduced to 0 is immobilized.  Tractor Beams have a range of
15 hexes.
<P>
     <B>Plasma Webs</B> pour very large amounts of super-heated plasma
into a powerful electroweak force lattice.  The plasma confines
itself to the webwork of lattice lines, which is then fired at an
opposing ship.  Upon reaching its target, the web spreads over
it, doing a maximum of 25 damage to each facing from the intense
heat.  The maximum is adjusted for range dissipation as if the
plasma web were a beam weapon (although it automatically hits its
target).  The electroweak lattice decays very slowly, confining
the plasma in a cascading torrent over the ship for several
combat rounds.  Each subsequent round, right as the webbed ship's
initiative comes around, the damage rating of the web is reduced
by 5 from the last round, and then again applied to all of the
webbed ship's facings.  Plasma Webs can be layered onto their
target, and are cumulative in their effect.  They have a maximum
range of 12 spaces.
<P>
     <B>Stasis Fields</B> create a very localized region where the
space and time components of spacetime are divorced from one
another.  In theory, the region of space, and everything in it,
exist simultaneously at all points in time, although it has been
determined that the principle of spacetime exclusion requires
each point in time to be in a space with a different quantum
number.  The net result is that a ship confined in the field
cannot take any action or be affected in any way until the field
has been removed.  The removal of the field restores normal
spacetime, and allows the ship to act normally again
(hyperspacial observations of stasis fields indicate that while
they do exist in hyperspace at a point dimensionally adjacent to
their location in normal space, they, and their contents vanish
in hyperspace when the field is removed.  In other words,
anything in the field always returns to normal space with no ill
effects).  A Stasis Field has a range of 3 hexes.  The ship
generating the field can only maintain one stasis field per
stasis field generator.  A planet or its instillations cannot be
encased in a stasis field.
<P>
     <B>Spatial Compressors</B> are legendary weapons from the era of
the Orion Empire;  The technology to build them has been lost to
the modern races.  In principle, a spatial compressor functions
much like a pulsar.  The compressor, however, creates an
expanding dimensional inversion/nullification field that cannot
be blocked by shields or armor.  The compressor causes 1-8   4
damage per size class of the target ship to all ships within 6
hexes, and this damage is done directly to the ship's SI (with
normal chances of a critical hit).  The damage to missiles and
fighters is 1-8   2, and the compressor ignores a missile's heavy
armor and a fighter's shields.
<P>
     <B>Black Hole Generators</B> are another artifact of the Orion
Empire whose secret has been lost to the modern races.  These
devices have a range of only 2 spaces, but they have a deadly
effect.  When fired they totally immobilize the target ship,
encasing it in a gravitic wake that produces a restoring force
that hyperbolically in strength, reaching infinity toward the
edge of the wake.  The next turn, the wake builds up strength
until, at the beginning of the second turn after its creation, it
triggers the total collapse of the space time continuum toward
the center of the spherical wake.  In other words, the wake
collapses into a black hole around the hapless ship imprisoned
inside!  This, of course, destroys the ship.  There is nothing
that can save a ship once it is confined in the gravitic wake --
even subspace teleporters are neutralized by this device!
<P>
<A NAME=specsys><H2>3.8 Special Systems</H2>
     Special Systems are designed to enhance a ship's abilities
and performance in combat.  Some of these systems also affect the
ship outside of combat.  Non-combat effects are covered in
another section; this section is exclusively devoted to the
combat effects of a special system.
     All special systems take up a certain amount of space; the
larger the ship, the more space the system takes up.  The amount
of space required is given in the table below, along with the
technology required for the system.  The table is followed by a
description of each system and its effects on combat.

<P>
    <B>ATCR Loaders</B> are powerful field boosters and auxillary
capacitors for the ship's torpedo launchers (ATCR, pronounced
'At-Ser', stands for Accelerated Torpedo Capacitor Recharge).
This system allows a ship to fire its torps every turn rather
than every other turn.
<P>
     <B>Achilles Targeting Units</B> quick scan and analyze enemy ship
data to determine weak points in the ship's armor and calculate
strategic firing points that make critical hits to vital internal
systems more likely.  This powerful analysis tool allows all
onboard beam and ballistic weapons to ignore the target's armor,
and increases the chance of a critical hit by +4.
<P>
     <B>Augmented Engines</B> are auxillary manuvering jets and engine
power boosters designed to give the ship a bonus to its combat
speed and manuverability.  Ships with this system gain a +5 to
combat speed and a +25 to ship defense.  Augmented Engine
criticals must be placed in the rear or side slots of the ship.
<P>
     <B>Automated Repair Units</B> are computer controlled drones and
damage control centers interfaced with the intention of quickly
repairing damaged onboard systems, reinforcing weakened
structure, and patching holes in the ship's armor.  A ship
equipped with a repair unit can restore an amount of damage equal
to 10% of the ship's total armor and SI each turn.  It will also
restore one system damaged by a critical hit each turn (player's
choice).  Damaged repaired to armor is applied evenly to all
facings when possible.
<P>
     <B>Battle Pods</B> are dedicated bays designed to add 50% to a
ship's total available space.  A number of critical slots equal
to the extra space divided by 10 (round normally) are also added,
and may be place wherever the designer wants.  Battle Pod space
can be filled with additional weapons and systems, but the
addition of mass invariably slows down the ship:  Every 20% of
the battle pod that is filled reduces the ship's combat speed by
1, for a maximum penalty of -5.
<P>
     <B>Battle Scanners</B> are dedicated targeting systems that
increase the ship offense by +50.
<P>
     <B>Cloaking Devices</B> create an optical (actually, it's a broad
spectrum) distortion field that makes the ship invisible to most
scanners.  A cloaked ship has a +80 bonus to ship defense.  The
capabilities.  While uncloaked, the ship loses its defensive
bonus.  The ship may recloak on its next turn, but only if it
doesn't fire any weapons.
<P>
     <B>Damper Fields</B> are a legendary, and impressive, technology
developed by the ancient Orions.  These devices create a field
around the ship that gravely lowers the value of Planck's
constant, sapping anything passing through of much of its kinetic
and radient energy.  Furthermore, thanks to the nature of quantum
effects, the field can be switched off just long enough to fire
weapons and then restored to full strength immediately.  The net
effects of this are impressive indeed:  75% of all damage
inflicted on the ship is simply absorbed by the field.
Furthermore, transporter beams and hard radiation cannot
penetrate the field at all.  The down side is that the field
makes shields equally useless -- a ship equipped with a damper
field simply cannot have a functional shield operating at the
same time, including a hard shield.  The technology to build
these devices has been lost since the time of the Orion Empire.
<P>
     <B>Displacement Devices</B> create a distortion field that makes a
ship appear to be in a different place than it really is.  This
gives all beam and ballistic weapons a flat 30% of missing,
regardless of other considerations, and gives the ship a +25% to
missile defense.
<P>
     <B>ECM Jammers</B> generate electronic interference in a missile or
torpedo guidance system that can often cause the warheads to go
astray.  Jammers add +75% to missile defense.
<P>
     <B>Energy Absorbers</B> interpose fields of null space in front of
oncoming beams, ballistic ordinance, and missile/torpedo
warheads.  The null space fields absorb about a quarter of the
kinetic/radient energy of the incoming firepower and store it in
the absorber.  In practice, the device blocks 25% of all incoming
damage (the damage blocking effect is applied after the effect of
a damper field), and stores it.  When it comes time for the ship
to move next, all of this stored energy (damage) is released at a
target within 48 hexes.  The energy bolt is very wide angle, and
automatically hits, and is rather cohesive (no range penalties).
Hit location is determined normally.
<P>
     <B>Fast Missile Racks</B> supply all of a ship's missile racks with
an auxillary, preloaded backup rack.  This allows the missile
racks to fire twice in the combat turn.  The missile racks then
fire at their normal rate until a turn is spend without firing to
allow the fast racks a chance to reload.
<P>
     <B>Hard Shields</B> increase the width of a shield's energy field,
and improve its integrety.  They absorb 3 damage from every
successful attack, even after the corresponding shield facing has
fallen.  They also allow a ship's shields to functin inside of a
nebula.
<P>
     <B>Heavy Armor</B> is a simple concept:  the ship is given an extra
layer of armored alloy that multiplies the number of available
armor points by three and protects the ship from armor piercing
weapons (although not the Achilles Targeting Unit, or an
Emissions Guidance Missile).
<P>
     <B>High Energy Foci</B> magnify and refocus all the beam weapons on
the ship, increasing their damage by 50% of their base damage
(i.e. a heavy beam weapon will still have its damage increased by
only 50% the normal beam weapon's damage).  This bonus does not
apply to ballistic weapons, missiles, or torps.
<P>
     <B>Hyper-X Capacitors</B> are energy storage batteries coupled with
an advanced cooling system that allow all of a ship's beam
weapons to fire twice as many times as normal.  The ship's beam
weapons may then fire normally until they go unused for a round.
This recharges the capacitors, allowing the beams to fire twice
again.
<P>
     <B>Inertial Nullifiers</B> create a stable hyperspacial field
around the ship, reducing its inertia almost to zero for
manuvering purposes.  This cuts the movement cost for changing
facing to 0 and gives the ship a +100 to defense.
<P>
     <B>Inertial Stabilizers</B> create a partial hyperspacial field
around the ship, significantly reducing its inertia for
manuvering purposes.  This cuts the movement cost for changing
facing to 2 MP per hexside change, and gives the ship a +50 to
defense.
<P>
     <B>Lightning Fields</B> surround the ship with a powerful ion field
that has a straight 50% chance of frying the guidance systems of
any incoming missiles, rupturing incoming torpedo containment
systems, and destroying the electronics on incoming fighters.
<P>
     <B>Multi-Phased Shields</B> generate several simultaneous deflector
shields, each with a differing phase constant.  Although the
inevitability of destructive interference greatly reduces the
strength of each shield, the total strength of all the phased
shields added together is greater than any individual shield.
The net result:  the amount of damage a ship's shields can absorb
(not the amount they can block) is increased by 50%.
<P>
     <B>Multi-Wave ECM Jammers</B> are a significant improvement over
the standard models, expanding their locking interference over
most of the electromagnetic spectrum and also blocking neutrino
and tachyon auxillery scanning devices.  This gives the ship a
+100% to missile defense, which is not cumulative with an ECM
Jammer.
<P>
     <B>Phasing Cloaks</B> are vastly improved Cloaking Devices that
work by shifting a ship halfway between normal space and
hyperspace.  This makes the ship totally inaccessable to both
dimensions, giving it complete immunity to all attacks, effects,
and damage, while allowing it to move and scan its surroundings
normally.  The ship must uncloak to fire, but may cloak again on
its next turn, provided it doesn't fire its weapon.  A phasing
cloak does, however, interfere with the neurological functions of
the crew (it partially phases out their neutral pathways, after
all).  As a safety precaution, the phasing cloak steps down to a
cloaking device after 10 turns of combat to prevent any perminant
damage to the crew.
<P>
     <B>Quantum Detonators</B> amplify the force of an engine explosion
by three times, and are programmed to go off anytime a ship loses
all of its structural integrety.  They also have a 50% chance of
detonating if the ship is succussfully captured.  Although the
computer controls for this device aren't complicated, the quantum
amplifiers used in the detonator itself haven't been seen since
the Orion Era.  This means the detonators haven't been used since
the Orion Era either.
<P>
     <B>Rangemaster Units</B> are computer targeting systems
specifically designed to compensate for a beam or ballistic
weapon's range inaccuracies.  A ship equipped with this system
reduces effective range to 1/3 to determine the range penalty to
hit only.
<P>
     <B>Reinforced Hulls</B> are straightforward.  The ship designer
trades internal space for extra structural support, and shielding
for the ship's internal systems.  This modification triples the
ship's SI value, and subtracts 4 from the ship's chances of
taking a critical hit when its internal structure is hit.
<P>
     <B>Security Stations</B> monitor vital areas of a military ship,
and attack any intruders with automated weapons systems.  This
increases the combat strength of all defending marines by 20.
<P>
     <B>Shield Capacitors</B> are powerful generators and battery
systems dedicated to providing auxillary power to the ship's
shields.  This improves the shield regeneration rate from 30% of
the maximum facing strength to 100%.
<P>
     <B>Structural Analyzers</B> are scanners that search out weak spots
in the ship's armor and structure.  They double the damage of all
beam and ballistic weapons that penetrate the shields.
<P>
     <B>Subspace Teleporters</B> allow a ship to make highly localized
combat jumps through hyperspace.  Essentially, once each turn,
the ship can teleport itself up to 18 hexes in any direction.
It's facing remains the same.  The teleporter does not improve
ship defense.
<P>
     <B>Transporters</B> are sophisticated matter-to-energy conversion
systems that scan the molecular patterns of something, living or
no, transform it into a targeted beam of photons, and then revert
the photons back to normal matter, duplicating the stored pattern
exactly.  This allows the ship to transport raiding parties to
enemy ship up to 12 hexes away, and bombs to a planet 12 hexes
away.  A transporter cannot beam through a deflector shield,
however, so the shield facing the transporting ship must be down,
and the ship can't have hard shields.  Furthermore, a damper
field seriously weakens the transporter beam, making it
impossible to restore the transported person.
<P>
     <B>Troop Pods</B> are like extra, on-ship barracks for marines.
Troop Pods double the number of marines on board the ship.
<P>
     <B>Warp Dissipaters</B> generate a powerful quantum stabilization
field that totally prevents any enemy ships from generating a
direct portal into hyperspace.  Although this has no effect on
intertial stabilizers and nullifiers, it does prevent sub space
teleporters from working, and prevents ships from retreating in
combat.
<P>
     <B>Wide Area Jammers</B> generate a powerful electromagnetic,
tachyonic, and neutrino interferance field that blankets the
equipped ship and every other ship in the fleet.  This gives the
equipped ship a +130% bonus to missile defense, and every other
ship a +75% missile defense.  The +75% defense is cumulative with
lesser jammers, but two Wide Area Jammers do not have a
cumulative effect.

<A NAME=antarans><H2>A. The Antarans:  Purveyors of Ultimate Galactic Evil</H2>
     The Antaran race deserves special metion.  Although their
background and aims are given elsewhere, the abilities possessed
by this Xenophobic race need to be elaborated on -- specifically
those that involve their ship design.<BR>
     The Antarans enjoy a level of technology far superior to all
the the galaxy's known extant races.  They are considered to have
access to all of the weapons and items listed in the preceeding
sections, including the Orion-Era technology.  If that weren't
bad enough, the Antarans are considered to have the tech level
appropriate to the full miniturization of all thier technology,
again, including the Orion-Era technology.
<P>
     As an example of an Antaran ship, the small-sized Antaran
Raider will do nicely:
