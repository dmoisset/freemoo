ADDING A SERVICE HOWTO:

Suppose we have a FOO in shared/.  If we want to add a service that
keeps our client's FOOs up to date we should:

- Add the service description in services-fm.txt!
In S_FOO:
- Inherit SERVICE, redefining subscription_message
- Also redefine any setter functions that modify variables or
  information included in the service to include an update_clients
- Define update_clients {ANY} to call send_message to the right clients,
  sending the service's subscription message (remember to check for
  registry /= Void)
- Define subscription message {ANY} to return a message as described in
  services-fm.txt.  If the class provides several services, inspect
  the service name first.
In C_FOO:
- Inherit SUBSCRIBER
- Define on_message to manage any and all messages we could receive,
  unpacking them accordingly.
Someplace:
- register our S_FOO in the server, and subscribe to the service in
  the client



ADDING A STORABLE HOWTO:

Suppose we want to add a FOO to the savegame.

- Add all foo instances to the dependants and fields of classes that
  refer to FOOs, and restore foos in these classes' make_from_storage
In S_FOO:
- Inherit from STORABLE, redefine fields and dependents if necesary.
- Define hash_code, fields, primary_keys, get_class, set_primary_keys
  and make_from_storage
- In S_GAME, register a S_FOO with the storage_xml (in load_game_from_file)
