<H1>Master of Orion 2 file formats</H1>

<P>This is my collection of data about the file formats of the files of
Master of Orion 2. I obtained them through reverse engineering, so the
meaning of some fileds here and there are missing; anyway this is enough
to interpret most of the data of this game.

<P>Note: all integer formats are named after the TurboPascal/FreePascal 
notation, i.e:
<TABLE BORDER=1>
   <TR><TD>Byte    </TD><TD>Unsigned 8-bits integer</TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>Word    </TD><TD>Unsigned 16-bits integer</TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>Cardinal</TD><TD>Signed 32-bits integer  </TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>Array[a..b] of T</TD><TD>An array of elements of type T, with
                                    indices greater than or equal to a and
                                    smaller than or equal to b</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>All data is stored in Intel endian inside MOO2 files. Numbers are in decimal
unless prefixed with $ (hexadecimal).

<A NAME="smk"><H2>SMK</H2>
<P>These are smacker videos; Smacker is a propietary format. Check 
<A HREF="http://www.radgametools.com">http://www.radgametools.com</A>, where 
you can download software to convert them to standard formats (AVI with 
several encodings, or MPEG-2 if you have the codec installed)

<A NAME="lbx"><H2>LBX</H2>
<P>".lbx" files are packages consisting of several unnamed files. Some files in
the MOO2 distribution have extension .lbx but are actually smacker videos
(see <A HREF="#smk">SMK</A> above), you can recognize them because they start
with <TT>SMK2</TT>. Real lbx files have the following format:
<TABLE BORDER=1>
   <TR>
      <TD><B>Offset</B></TD><TD><B>Type</B></TD><TD><B>Data</B></TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>0</TD><TD>Word</TD><TD>fc = file count. Number of files inside
                                 package</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>2</TD><TD>Word</TD><TD>$FEAD. I think it's just a magic ID</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>4</TD><TD>Cardinal</TD><TD>$0. magic? not sure</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>8</TD><TD>Array[0..fc] of Cardinal</TD>
      <TD>offsets. For each file number (i) in [0..fc-1], its data is stored in 
          the file at offsets [offsets[i]..offsets[i+1]-1]. Note that 
          offsets[0]=$800 always, and offsets[fc]=size of lbx file.</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>$800</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>files, sequentially stored. `offsets'
                                 determines where each one starts and ends</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Most of the data stored inside lbx files of MOO2 are:
<UL>
   <LI>Sound: in standard wave (.WAV) files
   <LI>images/animations: in a format I call "mpi" (Microprose Image) described
       below
</UL>
<P>There are also some text files and binary data spread around. Check unlbx.pp
for an implementation of a unpacker.

<A NAME="mpi"><H2>MPI</H2>

<P>These files contain one or more images forming a looped animation. The file
format is:
<TABLE BORDER=1>

      <TD>offsets. The i-th image (counting from 0) is stored at offset
      offsets[i] through offsets[i+1]-1</TD></TR>
   <TR>

      <TD>Palette, sometimes not present. If current offset=offsets[0], there is no
          palette. </TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>12+4*(imgcount+1)</TD><TD><A HREF="#tpalette">TPalette</A></TD>
      <TD>Palette, sometimes not present. If current offset=offsets[0], there is no
          palette. </TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>offsets[0]</TD><TD>sequence of <A HREF="#tscanline">TScanline</A></TD>
      <TD>First image, stored as a sequence of scanlines (check the format of
          each scanline, they're not linearly stored)</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>offsets[1]</TD><TD>sequence of <A HREF="#tscanline">TScanline</A></TD>
      <TD>Second image, and so on...</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="tpalette"><H3>TPalette</H3>
<P>This structure represents a palette or palette segment:
<TABLE BORDER=1>
   <TR>
      <TD><B>Offset</B></TD><TD><B>Type</B></TD><TD><B>Data</B></TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>0</TD><TD>Word</TD><TD>palstart = index of the first color stored in the palette segment</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>2</TD><TD>Word</TD><TD>palsize = number of colors in the palette segment</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>4</TD><TD>Array[0..palsize-1] of Cardinal</TD>
      <TD>list of colors. Each color is of the form $bbggrr00, where $rr, $gg and $bb
          are the red, green and blue components of the color, in range $00..$3F</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="tscanline"><H3>TScanline</H3>
<P>This structure represents a sequence of pixels of an image. Note that the
first scanline of each image is a little different.
<TABLE BORDER=1>
   <TR>
      <TD><B>Offset</B></TD><TD><B>Type</B></TD><TD><B>Data</B></TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>0</TD><TD>Word</TD><TD>count = number of pixels</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>2</TD><TD>Word</TD><TD>offset = x or y displacement</TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>4</TD><TD>Array[0..count*] of Byte</TD>
      <TD>Pixel sequence<BR>* if count is odd, this field has count+1 bytes.
          The value of the extra byte is ignored. The first scanline has not
          this field</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>When count is 0, offset indicates how many pixels below starts the next
scanline in the image (usually 1, i.e, the next). Otherwise, offset
indicates how many pixels to the right of the last pixel of the last scanline
is the first pizel of this scanline.
<P>The first scanline of an image has count=1 but no bytes of data; the offset
value is the y coordinate where the image starts. Usually, the last scanline
of an image has a count=0 and offset=1000 ($3E8)

In pseudocode, the following algorithm reads an image
<PRE>
   frame = 0
   while true do
      seek offsets[frame]
      get scanline with no data -- first scanline is special
      x = 0
      y = scanline.offset
      while y < height -- when the last scanline is read, y grows in 1000 making y>height
         get scanline
         if scanline.count=0
            x = 0
            y = y+scanline.offset
         else
            x = x+scanline.offset
            for i=0 to scanline.count-1
               pixel[x, y] = palette[scanline[i]]
               x = x+1
            endfor
         endif
      endwhile
      -- go to next frame
      frame = frame + 1
      if frame = imgcount then frame = imgloop
   endwhile
</PRE>

<P>An mpi viewer is implemented in mpview.pp
