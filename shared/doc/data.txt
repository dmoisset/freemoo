GALAXY GENERATION DATA

galaxy/starnames.txt: Names for non-homeworld starsystems. Each line contains a
                      name.
galaxy/sizes: Probabilities for star sizes. Sequence of integers for:
              small, medium, large.
galaxy/stars: attributes depending on star kind and not galaxy age. File
              contains:
              probability of having planet, one percentile int for each kind.
              planet gravity probabilities, three weights (lowG, normmalG,
              highG) for each kind
              probabilities for mineral richness, 5 weights (ultrapoor...
              ultrarich) for each kind
              kinds range from blackhole to brown, in the order declared in
              MAP_CONSTANTS
galaxy/xxx/stars: attributes depending on galaxy age. File contains:
                  Probability of each star color. A sequence of integers
                  for blackhole...brown.
                  Probability for planetary climate depending on star. There
                  are lines for blackhole...brown. Each line contains a
                  sequence of integers for toxic...gaia
                  xxx may be: average, orgrich, minrich
galaxy/planets: Probabilities for planets. File contains:
                Probability for each planetary size. Sequence of integers
                for tiny...huge
                Probability for planetary kinds. Three ints for
